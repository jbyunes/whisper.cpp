# Experiments on whisper.cpp

This is a fork from [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp), refer to it in production code.

This fork is intended to add some probes in the process.
One have been adopted into the original project (logs of best decoder scores of tokens).
Others are much more experimental to track best candidates for tokens.
